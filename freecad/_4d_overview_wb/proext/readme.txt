GA3D 4DOverview - Proprietary Extensions Folder
-----------------------------------------------

This folder is reserved for **proprietary or private extensions** built on top of the
GA3D 4DOverview core (licensed under the LGPL v2.1 or later).

Extensions placed here are *not part of the LGPL-licensed core* and may contain
company-specific logic, custom user interfaces, or integrations intended for
internal or commercial use.

Developers may:
- Keep their proprietary extensions closed-source.
- Distribute them privately to clients under a separate commercial license.
- Use the LGPL core as a dynamic library without affecting the proprietary
  status of their extensions, as long as no LGPL core code is copied or
  modified directly.


⚠️ Note:
Any modification made to the LGPL core (outside this folder) must be
published under the same LGPL license, as required by the Free Software
Foundation’s terms.
